# KI^2TE

This repo contains the code for [K^I2TE: Knowledge-Infused InterpreTable Embeddings for COVID-19 Misinformation Detection](https://wls.ai/kiite) by William Shiao and Evangelos E. Papalexakis.

The code is located in 3 directories: `analysis` for code processing the dataset, `crawler` for collecting the large news dataset, and `factcheck` for collecting the claims dataset.

The actual collected dataset is too large to upload to GitHub, and will be uploaded to a different site soon.
